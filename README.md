# RGB-Color-Map

## Introduction

A basic program that<b> receives a grayscale image and returns an image in pseudocolors</b>, colored by one of the palettes generated by the <b>get_cmap()</b> provided by <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> module. In addition to the input image, the program also read the name of the palette that will be generated and used in the colorization. Matplotlib library provides dozens of ready-made color palettes that can be use to generate indexed pseudo color images.

## How to use

### Input 
<b>The application will look for images in the same directory as the source code</b> (accepting <b>jpeg, png and tiff formats</b>), asking which image do you wanna load. After that, you have to write the color palette that will be applied. The list of available color palettes can be seeing <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html">here</a>. 

### Output

The output will be the image with the color palette applied. a preview of the output will be shown in a new window by OpenCv, you can either save the image or not. <b>The saved image will be in the same directory as the source code</b>.

An example of output using the color palette "inferno" (input on the left, output on the right):
<div style = "display: inline-block;">
